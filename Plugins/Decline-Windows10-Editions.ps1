.SYNOPSIS
Decline updates for editions of Windows 10 your organization does not support.
.DESCRIPTION
Decline updates for editions of Windows 10 your organization does not support.
.NOTES
You must un-comment the $SupportedEditions variable and add the editions your organization supports.
The KnownEditions variable holds a list of known editions to _try_ and prevent the script from going rogue if MS decides to change the naming scheme.  If ... or when ... they do this will need to be updated.
